### TODO ###

// from shop
fhrs:id    // Don't know.  When a restaurant moves, does it keep its FHRS ID or is it attached to the building? https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:fhrs:id
fvst:navnelbnr  // Same thing as fhrs:id, apparently, but for DK: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:fvst:navnelbnr 
ncat            // Same thing, but for hospitality industry in South Korea (?)
wikidata   // Tricky. Could be about the POI (in which case it should go) or about the building (in which case it should stay).
