- scripta za add samo "KEYS_TO_REMOVE" iz keys.txt u SC format
- warn if all keys have at least $min_fraction uses (so we need to fetch more with wget!)
- print STDERR statistics (tags to keep, tags to remove)
- also do for other keys, not just "shop=" (see ticket #3244 and source)
- need to keep: 'barrier' and similar; are they added? see https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/pull/3045#issuecomment-887663272
- script to detect duplicates in keys.txt (eg. note:* and note:en)
