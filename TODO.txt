- scripta za add samo "KEYS_TO_REMOVE" iz keys.txt u SC format
- warn if all keys have at least $min_fraction uses (so we need to fetch more with wget!)
- print STDERR statistics (tags to keep, tags to remove)
- also do for other keys, not just "shop=" (see ticket #3244 and source)
- allow "#" and "//" comments after the key name in the same line
