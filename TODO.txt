- script to convert only "### KEYS TO REMOVE ###" from keys.txt into SC Kotlin format
- print STDERR statistics (tags to keep, tags to remove)
- script to detect duplicates in keys.txt (eg. note:* and note:en)
- add also minimum limit of tags? No sense for wading through tags is it is used only 50 times worldwide (usually in one place, too)
